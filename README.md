## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required tools
flutter --version  # 3.19+
node --version      # 18+
firebase --version  # Latest
gh --version        # GitHub CLI
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Domusgpt/crystal-grimoire-fresh.git
cd crystal-grimoire-fresh

# 2. Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Install Functions dependencies  
cd functions && npm install && cd ..

# 4. Configure Firebase
firebase login
firebase use crystal-grimoire-2025  # Your project ID

# 5. Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env

# 6. Run development server
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Firebase Hosting
```bash
# Build and deploy
flutter build web --release --base-href="/"
firebase deploy --only hosting,functions
```

### GitHub Pages (static marketing site)
The `public/` directory contains the static landing experience, bundled with Vite to produce an optimized `dist/` output. The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`) installs dependencies, runs `npm run build`, and uploads the `dist/` folder as a Pages artifact.

For local iteration on the holographic landing page:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the Vite dev server on 0.0.0.0:4173 (for screenshots or device testing)
npm run dev -- --host --port 4173

# Build the production bundle consumed by GitHub Pages
npm run build
```

1. In your repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.
2. Set the deployment branch to the branch you want (e.g., `work` for preview PRs or `main` for production) — the workflow triggers on both.
3. Merge the branch; the action will build and deploy automatically. The published site will mirror the `public/` folder contents.
4. If you instead point Pages to the branch **root** (without the Actions artifact), GitHub will try to render `README.md`. To cover that case, a lightweight `index.html` lives in the repo root and immediately redirects visitors to `./public/` so the marketing site loads either way.

> All assets use relative paths, so the page works whether it is served from the root domain or a Pages subpath.

#### Local preview + phased testing
- Serve the static site locally: `python -m http.server 3000 --directory public` then visit `http://localhost:3000`.
- Verify hero morphing journey: scroll the pinned hero to confirm the four epitaxial states, the morphing card stack rotations, and the progress bar advancing smoothly over ~800vh.
- Toggle “Reduce motion” in system accessibility settings to confirm pinned sections unpin and the canvas visualizer stays idle.
- Inspect beta form validation (required email) and CTA microcopy update after submit.
- Walk through the new multi-zone parallax scaffold: ascent (upward drift), gallery (downward drift), features, and journey/beta zones. Confirm opposing parallax directions and pinned stretches behave without stutter.
- Gallery assets now live in `public/assets/app-shots/` (SVG placeholders): oracle home, lunar ritual, collection vault, and sound bath. Validate lazy loading and hover tilts on desktop.

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required in Firebase Functions config
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```
