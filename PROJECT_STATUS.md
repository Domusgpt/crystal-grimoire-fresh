# üîÆ Crystal Grimoire ‚Äì Project Status

**Updated:** September 2025  
**Stage:** Beta hardening (auth + paywall live, polishing remaining)

## Snapshot
Crystal Grimoire now ships an end-to-end Flutter Web experience backed by Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Cloud Functions. Users can authenticate, manage settings, add crystals to their cloud-synced collection, review guidance/dream history, and upgrade through Stripe (web) or RevenueCat (mobile). Remaining work focuses on polishing AI content, enriching the crystal library, and preparing observability/deployment automation.

## Recently completed
- Rebuilt Settings, Account, and Collection flows around Firestore so every toggle or entry persists for authenticated users.
- Implemented Stripe checkout + RevenueCat bridging with shared entitlement math and consistent renewal messaging.
- Hardened dream analysis + identification pipelines and migrated legacy identifications into per-user subcollections.
- Removed legacy placeholder services and demo stubs; all surviving screens wire into production data/services.
- Documented environment configuration, troubleshooting, and deployment workflow (`README.md`, `DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.me`, `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`).

## In-flight / upcoming
| Area | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Crystal library curation | üöß | Seed additional crystals with verified metadata + imagery. |
| AI prompt tuning | üöß | Add safety filters + richer persona options for dream/guidance endpoints. |
| Usage telemetry | ‚è≥ | Hook analytics / logging for AI token consumption + paywall conversion. |
| Push notifications | ‚è≥ | Implement FCM/App Check gating before GA. |
| QA automation | ‚è≥ | Add widget tests + Function integration coverage for paywall + identification. |
| Marketing site polish | ‚è≥ | Finish landing page copy/assets once compliance review completes. |

## Outstanding risks
- **Configuration drift:** Ensure every deployment supplies required dart-defines and Functions config (see `EnvironmentConfig.validateConfiguration()` output).
- **Legacy data migration:** Production Firestore must migrate any top-level `identifications` or pre-SPEC profile documents using the provided migration helpers before rollout.
- **AI costs:** Track Gemini usage; add budget alerts before scaling past pilot.

## Next steps before handoff to deployment
1. Provision Stripe/Gemini keys in the target Firebase project and run a full checkout round-trip.
2. Populate `crystal_library` with launch SKUs and verify collection hydration across cold boots/offline.
3. Execute smoke tests: Settings save, collection add/remove, dream analysis, guidance, paywall purchase/cancel, account deletion.
4. Update this report after testing to reflect launch readiness.
